# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
The BigMart Sales Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast sales for products in various BigMart stores. The dataset contains sales records for 1,600 products across 10 stores, and the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate sales based on various features.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

**Data Description**
The dataset consists of several features, including:

Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for each product
Item_Weight: Weight of the product
Item_Fat_Content: Indicates if the product is low-fat or regular
Item_Visibility: The percentage of the product that is visible to customers
Item_Type: Category of the product
Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for each store
Outlet_Size: Size of the store
Outlet_Location_Type: Type of location (urban, semi-urban, rural)
Outlet_Type: Type of store (grocery, supermarket, etc.)
Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the store (target variable)

**Features**
Data preprocessing techniques for handling missing values
Feature engineering for enhancing model performance
Visualization techniques for data analysis
Model training with linear regression and random forest algorithms

**Modeling Techniques**
Linear Regression: Used for baseline model performance.
Random Forest: Employed for better accuracy through ensemble learning.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques used to optimize model parameters.
Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting sales, with performance metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² score evaluated for model performance.
